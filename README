NAME

Graphics::Color - Device and library agnostic color spaces.

SYNOPSIS

Graphics color is a device and library agnostic system for creating and
manipulating colors in various color spaces.

  my $color = Graphics::Color::RGB->new(
      red => .5, green => .5, blue => .5, alpha => .5
  );
  say $color->as_string;

DISCLAIMER

I'm not an art student or a wizard of arcane color knowledge.  I'm a normal
programmer with a penchant for things graphical.  Hence this module is likely
incomplete in some places.  Patches are encouraged.  I've intentions of adding
more color spaces as well as conversion routines (where applicable).
